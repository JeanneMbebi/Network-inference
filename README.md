# Network-inference

## 1. Goal of the project 

This project is about the reconstruction of networks of biochemical reactions each involving multiple substrates and products together with their stoichiometries, given time-resolved profiles of the compounds

## 2. Assumptions
The approach here assumes mass action kinetics, largely applicable to non-enzymatic (bio)chemical systems, and employs replicated time-resolved relative levels for the
considered compounds. 

## 3. Used techniques

- Constrained regularized regression
- Mathematical programming using R

## 4. Data 
Metabolomics profiles obtained from a glycine hydrothermal reaction
